- ETL stands for Extract, Transform, and Load 
- Loading means writing the data to its destination environment 
- Cloud platforms are enabling ELT to become an emerging trend 
- The key differences between ETL and ELT include the place of transformation, flexibility, Big Data support, and time-to-insight 
- There is an increasing demand for access to raw data that drives the evolution from ETL, 
which is still used, to ELT, which enables ad-hoc, self-serve analytics 
- Data extraction often involves advanced technology including database querying, web scraping, and APIs  
- Data transformation, such as typing, structuring, normalizing, aggregating, and cleaning, is about formatting data to suit the application 
- Information can be lost in transformation processes through filtering and aggregation 
- Data loading techniques include scheduled, on-demand, and incremental 
- Data can be loaded in batches or streamed continuously
